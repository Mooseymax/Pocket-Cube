# Pocket-Cube
Collection of code snippets for use in the Pocket Cube game.

The game itself will be being built in ~~Unreal 4 with C++ being used where blueprints are not complex enough.~~ Unity with c# being the main programming language.

##Order of development:

###Storing and calling data
1. Decide on a configuration filetype [Done] - JSON
2. Store 3 Cubes in JSON [Done]
3. Store Player Data in JSON [Done]
4. Store 2 - 4 Moves in JSON [Done]
5. Call Player Data to program and display a usercard
6. Call specific Cube through user input and list cube details
7. Set Moves that Cubes can learn (Example: Cube 1 - 1 & 2, Cube 2 - 1 & 3, Cube 3 - 2 & 4)
8. Call specific Cube through user input and list moves Cube can learn
9. Set areas 1, 2 & 3 and set 2 Cubes to each area
10. Call either first or second Cube at random based on what area user inputs

More to come! Will be expanding the list once I get down to about 7.
